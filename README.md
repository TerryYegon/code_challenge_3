#  Blog Post Manager

##  Project Description

**Blog Post Manager** is a single-page web application that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts. It is designed for users to easily manage and share blog content interactively.

The app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end and a local `db.json` file (served via `json-server`) as the backend to store blog data. Each blog post includes a **title**, **author**, **content**, and an **image URL**.
